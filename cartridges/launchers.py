    exact form TwinTail itself writes into generated ``.desktop`` shortcuts.
    The ``=`` form is used here to mirror upstream.

    TwinTail is often installed only as a Flatpak, in which case no
    ``twintaillauncher`` binary exists on the host and the host form would
    fail with exit status 127. Fall back to the Flatpak then; when neither
    backend is found keep the host form as a best effort.

    NOTE: the flag is only honored on a cold start. TwinTail's single-instance
    plugin discards argv when an instance is already running (it only
    shows/focuses the window), so callers must terminate any running
    TwinTail instance before launching — see ``run_executable``. Fixes #17.
