"""Read repack and giveaway RSS feeds as *news*: everything that is not a digest.

One document, two readers with opposite appetites.
:mod:`cartridges.utils.updates_feed` wants the periodic *Updates Digest* posts,
whose bodies are machine fodder for the per-game patch notice. This module wants
the other half — new repacks, site announcements, anything a person would
actually sit and read — and drops the digests on the floor.

That exclusion is the whole point of the split and it only goes one way. A
digest never reaches the Novidades page: its body is a wall of collapsible
spoiler markup that reads as noise, and every game it names is already surfaced
on that game's own details page. Conversely a news post is never handed to the
update matcher, which would happily mistake a repack announcement for a patch.

The page aggregates sources into one list (see ``NEWS_FEEDS``): the repack feed
above, the GamerPower "all giveaways" feed and the FreeToKeep "everything free
to keep" feed. The GamerPower sub-feeds (pc/steam/xbox/...) overlap with its
``/rss/giveaways`` aggregate, so only the aggregate is polled. Each post carries
its source label so the row can show where it came from.

Portuguese readers get a fourth source. The TrinityWeb Games feed publishes
exclusively in Portuguese (its ``<language>`` is pt-BR), so it is listed
separately in ``_PT_BR_FEEDS`` and only polled when the UI language is
Brazilian Portuguese — see :func:`feeds_for_language`. In any other locale the
rows would be prose nobody can read, so the source is skipped entirely rather
than shown and ignored.

Only the parts of an ``<item>`` that a list row can show are kept: title, link,
publication date, source and a short plain-text excerpt cut out of the HTML summary.

The user can turn individual sources off. A disabled source is dropped before
the request goes out, so it is never polled at all — not merely hidden — and
its posts never reach the page. This module stays pure data: it only knows
*which* sources are disabled, never where that answer comes from. The enabled
state lives in GSettings and reaches this module as a list of labels; see
:mod:`cartridges.utils.news_checker`.
