"""Watch the news feeds for readable posts and drive the header-bar badge.

Same shape as :class:`~cartridges.utils.updates_checker.UpdatesChecker` — a
worker thread does the network, everything that touches the UI is bounced back
onto the main thread with ``GLib.idle_add`` — but the two watch feeds for
opposite things and share nothing but the download helper. This one holds the
posts it fetched so opening the Novidades page is instant and re-opening it
costs no request.

Novelty is a single number. ``news-last-seen-ts`` records the publication date
of the newest post the user has already been shown; the badge is lit whenever
the feed carries something newer. Opening the page acknowledges everything on
it, which is why the whole "unread" state survives restarts without keeping a
list of post ids anywhere.

The very first successful poll after installation is treated as a baseline
rather than as news: with no record of what the user has seen, every post in the
feed is technically unseen, and lighting the badge for a back-catalogue nobody
missed would make it mean nothing. That poll stores the timestamp silently, and
the badge from then on only ever marks posts that landed while the user was
watching.

Sources can be turned off one by one. A disabled source is never polled, and
its posts never enter the cache, so the page and the badge only ever talk about
the sources the user still wants.
