# The Project

Jolven gathers your games from Steam, Heroic, Lutris, Bottles, emulators, native Linux games and manually added titles into one console-style library. It runs two ways:

- **Desktop mode** — Jolven as a regular app inside GNOME, KDE or another graphical environment.
- **Jolven Session** — a dedicated graphical session started straight from the display manager, fullscreen and gamepad-driven, before GNOME or KDE even load. Leaving the session returns you to the login screen.

Jolven is **not** a Linux distribution, **not** an operating system and **not** a desktop environment. It runs on top of the Linux you already have:

> Install Jolven on your existing Linux distribution and turn your PC into a console whenever you want.

## Why Jolven?

> Linux already has excellent gaming infrastructure. Jolven focuses on the missing piece: a unified, controller-first experience that can make a regular Linux PC feel like a console without replacing the operating system.

## Features

### One library for everything you play

Manually add and edit games, or let Jolven pull them in automatically from:

- Steam
- Lutris
- Heroic (Epic, GOG, Amazon, sideloaded)
- Bottles
- itch
- Legendary
- RetroArch
- Dolphin
- Yuzu
- TwinTail
- Flatpak
- Desktop Entries
- Xbox Cloud Gaming (experimental)

Filter by source, search, sort by title, date added or last played, and hide the games you don't want on the couch.

### A library that looks amazing with zero effort

You press play — Jolven takes care of the shelf. No hunting for images, no blank tiles:

- **Covers that find themselves** — automatic artwork from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/), with a visual picker to choose your favorite in one click.
- **Animated covers** — your shelf comes alive with motion covers for the games you love.
- **Logos, not just titles** — clean game logos on tiles and details, so the library feels like a real console.
- **Details that help you choose** — synopsis, genres, players, co-op, age rating, release date and platform, powered by [TheGamesDB](https://thegamesdb.net/).
- **Screenshots that set the mood** — real in-game captures via [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/) in full HD, used as the backdrop of your library.
- **Wallpapers that match your taste** — automatic and hand-picked backgrounds from [Wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/), with filters for category, color and mood.
- **Fallbacks that never leave you hanging** — if one source doesn't know your game, Jolven tries the next one automatically (IGDB → TheGamesDB → Wallhaven). Your library always looks finished.

> Bring your own free API keys in Preferences and unlock the full magic. Without keys, Jolven still works — with keys, it shines.

### A room that plays along with you ✨

Jolven talks to your **Tuya / Smart Life LED strips** over your local network:

- The room glows in Jolven purple when you open the app.
- When a game starts, the lights dress up in that game's color — pulled straight from its cover.
- When you quit, everything returns to exactly how it was — even if the lights were off.

One-time setup with a friendly wizard, credentials stored encrypted, and from then on it's all local and automatic. Movie night energy, every game night.

### Fast where it matters, quiet where it doesn't

- **Playtime and session tracking** — see how long you've actually played each game, automatically.
- **Per-game launch profiles** — set resolution, FPS limit, scaling, working folder and extra options once per title, then just press play.
- **GameMode + MangoHud + Gamescope, without the terminal** — toggle performance boosts and overlays per game or globally, from a normal settings screen.
- **Xbox Cloud Gaming (experimental)** — native player (no browser): sign in with your Microsoft account and stream from the cloud alongside your installed games.
- **Sunshine streaming** — export games to Sunshine with one click or automatically, then play them over Moonlight on any screen.
- **Settings behind authentication** — system installs ask for your password before opening Preferences (polkit on Linux, Windows Hello on Windows).
- **Waydroid apps** — import installed Android games with their package ids and local icons, while filtering system utilities.
- **GNOME search provider** — hit Super, type a game name, press Enter.
- **Animated, gamepad-first interface** — every screen works from the couch, with hotplug controllers, an on-screen keyboard and a global menu (library, power, session).

### Xbox Cloud Gaming (experimental)

Jolven plays Xbox Cloud Gaming with a **native player** — no browser involved:

- Sign in with your Microsoft account using a **device code** (`microsoft.com/devicelogin` on your phone or PC — your password is never typed into the app). An embedded-browser login is also available.
- Cloud streaming needs **Game Pass Ultimate**; streaming from your own console at home (xHome) works too.
- Missing GStreamer streaming plugins (ICE/libnice) are **installed by the app itself** with a system password prompt, followed by an automatic restart. System installs (`/usr`) also register the required polkit policy; fresh installs via `install.sh` already include the plugins.
- Troubleshooting: launch a game and watch the log under `~/.cache/jolven/logs/` — every page load prints an `xCloud:` diagnostics line (browser signals, WebRTC/MediaSource/codec support, script status).

> Streaming uses an unofficial client implementation inspired by [Greenlight](https://github.com/unknownskl/greenlight) (GPL-3.0). Microsoft may change the service and break it; reports with logs are welcome.

### Streaming via Sunshine (Moonlight)

Jolven exports your games to [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) (self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight):

- Open a game's menu and choose **Add to Sunshine**, or turn on the automatic sync in Preferences to export new games as they arrive (Xbox Cloud Gaming titles are skipped).
- The export writes to your local Sunshine `apps.json` — no account, no network — preserving anything already there.
- The Sunshine Web UI password you type in Preferences is masked and kept in your system keyring (Secret Service), not in a plain settings file.
- Then open [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) on your TV, phone or another PC and play.

### Gravação de tela e streaming (GPU Screen Recorder)

Jolven can drive the native [GPU Screen Recorder](https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder/) from the in-game overlay. The recorder is optional: install the `gpu-screen-recorder` binary (or the Flatpak [com.dec05eba.gpu_screen_recorder](https://flathub.org/apps/com.dec05eba.gpu_screen_recorder)) and enable it in Preferences. Without it, the rest of Jolven keeps working normally.

- **Preferences page** — choose the capture source (portal, monitor or focused window), container, codec, quality, bitrate mode, FPS, resolution and cursor, plus the audio source, codec and bitrate, the replay buffer length and storage, and the output folder.
- **Overlay controls** — while a game is running, a click on the record button starts or stops recording and a right-click flushes the replay buffer to disk.
- **Auto-record per game** — a game can start recording automatically when it is launched.
- **Replay buffer** — keep the last few seconds in RAM or on disk and save a clip on demand.
- **Streaming** — send the capture to an RTMP, SRT or WHIP URL instead of a file.

Your existing data is safe: on first launch, Jolven copies the library, covers, settings, favorites and metadata from the previous `cartridges` folders into its own folders. The originals are never deleted. GSettings keys are migrated the same way (new keys win when already customized).

# Installation

Jolven roda apenas em Linux. Baixe o binário da última
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/zonaro/jolven/releases) ou compile do
código-fonte (veja [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#building)).

On Fedora, install the latest binary release for your user with:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonaro/jolven/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads the prebuilt binary from the latest GitHub Release,
installs any missing runtime dependencies and extracts Jolven under
`~/.local`. To compile from source instead, pipe into `bash -s -- --source`.
Each build is versioned `YY.DDD.HHMM` (2-digit year, day of year, 24h
hour+minute of the compilation) — see `scripts/publish-release.sh`.

## Appearance and themes

Jolven ships its own theme engine. Open **Preferences → Appearance** to pick a
theme from a gallery of 24 palettes, switch between light, dark and automatic
modes, and choose an accent colour (preset or custom) — all applied live, with
no restart. The default is the **Jolven** theme, which keeps the app's
purple/lilac identity and adds optional RGB glows.

The same appearance profile can be applied to Steam: enable **Apply skin to
Steam** (off by default) and Jolven installs, syncs, repairs and restores a
bundled [Adwaita-for-Steam](https://github.com/tkashkin/Adwaita-for-Steam) skin,
without any external skin manager. Native, Flatpak and Snap Steam installs are
detected. See [.agents/themes.md](.agents/themes.md) for details.

## Building manually

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#building).

## Jolven Session

Jolven can also be the frontend of a standalone Gamescope session. This
does not start GNOME Shell and does not change normal desktop launches. The
same application and library are used in both modes.

### Requirements and installation (Fedora)

Build and install Jolven normally, then run:

```sh
./scripts/install-game-session.sh
```

The installer verifies Fedora, checks `gamescope`, `gamemode`, and
`libmanette`, installs only missing packages with DNF, validates the session
desktop file, and installs the session launcher under `/usr`. It never
removes dependencies or changes GPU, SELinux, PAM, or GDM settings. MangoHud
is optional.

The application menu also exposes **Install Jolven Session** or **Uninstall
Jolven Session**, according to the current state. It uses the normal polkit
authorization dialog.

Log out, select **Jolven Session** from the display manager's session
chooser, and sign in. Closing Jolven ends Gamescope and returns to the login
screen. To remove only the session integration:

```sh
./scripts/uninstall-game-session.sh
```

### Development and configuration

Test the console UI without logging out:

```sh
jolven --game-mode --windowed
```

(`--jolven-session` works as an alias for `--game-mode`.)

The Session preferences page controls GameMode, optional MangoHud, Gamescope
VRR/FPS limiting, cursor hiding, and the preferred display, audio output and
audio input when multiple devices are available. It also selects whether the
in-game overlay opens with Button Mode, Button Home, or either one. Default
settings preserve the existing desktop launch behavior. Each game's details dialog has a
persisted launch profile for global GameMode/MangoHud overrides, working
directory, JSON environment, Gamescope options, FPS limit, resolution,
scaling and an optional process name for launcher hand-offs.

Gamepad navigation uses libmanette and supports hotplug; D-pad/left stick
navigate, the south face button confirms, the east face button goes back,
Start opens the page menu, and Guide/Home opens the global menu. That menu can
return to the library, close the current tracked game, suspend, restart, shut
down or leave the Jolven Session. Power actions use systemd-logind over D-Bus
and do not call sudo.

While a tracked game is running, the configured Mode/Home button brings the
Jolven overlay to the front. From there users can return to the game, add a
session note, finish tracking, or open an installed
[GPU Screen Recorder](https://flathub.org/apps/com.dec05eba.gpu_screen_recorder)
from the recording icon. The integration supports its registered desktop app
(including Flatpak) and native GTK/UI executables; GPU Screen Recorder remains
optional.

### Troubleshooting

Session launcher messages are available with:

```sh
journalctl -t jolven-session -b
journalctl --user -b | grep -i jolven
```

Check `gamescope --version`, `gamemoded -t`, and the app log under
`~/.cache/jolven/logs/` when a component fails. The session retries once
with safe Gamescope defaults if monitor, VRR, or limiter options fail during
startup.

Known limitations: HDR is deliberately not enabled automatically; Guide/Home
delivery depends on the controller and its driver; a launcher that deliberately
detaches without Steam/Flatpak identity may need its process name configured
in the game profile; Flatpak builds cannot install a host GDM session
themselves. The previous PipeWire defaults are restored when the session exits.

The implementation and responsibility boundaries are documented in
[`docs/game-mode-architecture.md`](docs/game-mode-architecture.md).
